## Description


## Evaluation


## Allocation of Effort
All coding, mathmatical calculations, and documentation on this project was done independently. I consulted various online programming resources while working on this assignment - citations are in the relevant comments. I also discussed high-level strategy and approaches for this assignment with peers from class and the robotics lab.
