## Test Cases
* Start: (0.1, 0.1), Goal: (9.5, 9.5) --> should fail because start cell is occupied
* Start: (0.7, 0.7), Goal: (9.5, 9.5) --> should fail because goal cell is occupied

## Allocation of Effort
All coding, mathmatical calculations, and documentation on this project was done independently. I consulted various online programming resources while working on this assignment - citations are in the relevant comments. I also discussed high-level strategy and approaches for this assignment with peers from class and the robotics lab.
